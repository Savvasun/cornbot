### Commands
`$help` writes a help message with this text.

`$say [any string]` says what you write after the command.

`$prefix [new prefix]` changes the prefix for the bot until it is restarted.

`$showdata` shows the data from the bot's JSON file in a readable format. Currently used for testing purposes, not useful.

`$datareset` resets all data in the JSON file. Only sav can use it.

`$seduce` spits out a random pickup line. Will add more over time.
